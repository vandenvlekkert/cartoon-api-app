# giphy-api-app
Project Title:
In this project, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, I called the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.

To try it out for yourself, I have included a Heroku link to test.

(1)  To test it, type in any cartoon or click on the buttons to see a cartoon Giphy appear.
